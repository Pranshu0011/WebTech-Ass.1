      <p>HTML is used extensively in various real-world scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Website Development: HTML is the starting point for building any website. Web developers use HTML to create the structure and content of web pages, defining headings, paragraphs, navigation menus, forms, and more.</li>
        <li>Responsive Design: HTML plays a crucial role in creating responsive websites that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Developers use HTML5 features like semantic elements and media queries to build layouts that adjust gracefully on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
        <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Properly structured HTML improves a website's SEO by making it easier for search engine crawlers to index and understand the content. Using semantic markup and descriptive tags helps search engines accurately interpret the context and relevance of the content, potentially leading to higher rankings in search results.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: HTML accessibility features, such as alt attributes for images and semantic markup for headings and landmarks, ensure that websites are usable by people with disabilities. By following accessibility best practices, developers can create inclusive web experiences that cater to a diverse audience.</li>
